# Media-Extractor
A DLL that, when injected, will extract most* media (PNG, JPG, ZIP, etc.) from a process's memory.

This was a project I worked on back in March of 2012. Some things may not fully work, parts of the code may be ugly, and you should probably not use the code as a reference for how to program.
